In the present days, we know everyone is rushing towards technology and all are investing time to adopt Blockchain technologies into their businesses. Nowadays, upcoming startups are moving towards initial coin offering which can be the independent monetary system to control the complete eco-system of their organization as well some external parts of the organization.

The main moto of initial coin offering is to create a new cryptocurrency and distribute their newly created tokens into the market by enormous promotions and discounts for the future value proportion.

This tokens can have the real monetary value like as same as ethereum and bitcoin have. These tokens can be used by everyone according to the valid places for the exchange of these tokens by a respective company or organization.

The implementation of cryptocurrency is placed in the path: https://github.com/sugalivijaychari/Ethereum_Blockchain/tree/master/CryptoCurrency

We can say the initial coin offering as a systematic procedure to distribute the tokens into the public, investors as well as developers.

The reason behind this robust ecosystem is blockchain particularly ethereum blockchain as every transaction is permanently recorded in ethereum and no one can change it.

Hence, the practical implementation of the whole ecosystem can be possible with smart contracts written through solidity language.

The path for the smart contracts of "Initial Coin Offering" is: https://github.com/sugalivijaychari/Ethereum_Blockchain/tree/master/InitialCoinOffering/contracts
